<h2 id="about_me">About Me</h2>

<p>My name is Afnan Sultan. I am a Senior Computer Science student seeking graduation in Spring 2020. Upon graduation, I plan to work in the industry as a full-stack developer for a cause I care about. I enjoy programming, and like to think of myself as a problem solver. One cool fact about me is that I participated in not only the IEEE Extreme Competition, I took 13 students down to Miami to compete in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest" target="_blank">ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest.</a> Currently, I intern at a company called Spinspire, a consulting and training company emphasizing Drupal and web development. I plan on obtaining another internship before graduation to crystallize my abilities, and to learn new ones.</p>
<br />
<p>I was born in Orange Park, Florida. I am the first son to parents originally from Pakistan. I speak English, Urdu, and a little bit of Spanish and Punjabi. After college, I would like to work in the industry, travel, and possibly return to an academic institution for a Master's degree (especially if my future employer is willing to subsidize it). I would also eventually like to start a family. I love Florida and hope to stay in the Sunshine State. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu" target="_blank">Click here to learn more about Urdu.</a></p>

<h2 id="hobbies_and_interests">Hobbies & Interests</h2>

<p>I enjoy spending time with friends and family. They are the most important, and should always be kept by your side. I also have a pet cat named Solomon. However, everyone just refers to him as "Billi," which means "cat" in Urdu/Hindi. During the Spring Semester, my cousins and I took a trip to Universal after not being able to see each other for years. Above is a picture from the trip, and below is me spending time with my kitty.</p>

<p>Two more hobbies of mine include recreational weightlifting and jogging. Not only is cardiovascular activity great for your heart, it is a great way to relieve stress and wind down after a long day. Strengh training is not as important, but provides utility, possibly aesthetics, and a means to protect oneself in situations such as an unexpected violent confrontation. I recommend all students find regular time to exercise, as there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_exercise#Aerobic_versus_anaerobic_exercise" target="_blank">numerous health benefits associated with anaerobic and aerobic activities.</a></p>

<h2 id="education">Education</h2>
<p>My main education goal currently is to simply graduate with a Bachelor of Science with a Concentration in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science" target="_blank">Computer Science.</a> I am taking advantage of UNF's Computing department, and would like to explore areas of Computing I have not touched, such as Databases, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and databases. In the future, I plan on either returning to UNF for a Master's degree in Computing and Info Science, or earning it at another institution in Florida.</p>
<p>Regarding a master's degree, I have been advised by Dr. Asaithambi to get it earlier rather than later. Work experience is also important, and I would prefer to work for at least a year before seeking another academic endeavor. That way, I will have experience (and more knowledge that a degree itself cannot provide, which could also make things smoother. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%27s_degree" target="_blank">Here is more information regarding a Master's degree.</a> Below is a brief list of diplomas and degrees I am working towards.</p>
